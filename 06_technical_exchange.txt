Let's start a technical exchange.
Relax and enjoy this workshop.

First, write your skills in post-it.
You can write as many as you like.

Write your name small in the upper left corner of the post-it.
The writing time is 10 minutes.

Let's talk about the technology when everyone is finished writing.
We will talk one by one.

Let's talk together if there are people writing the same skill.
Eventually, if you paste it on the whiteboard while categorizing it, the skill map of the gamegift development team will be completed.

Do you have any question?
